>>    The inference script demonstrates how to use the trained model on new, unlabeled data (for which ground truth emitter labels are not known).
 	It loads a pulse train, runs the model to get embeddings, clusters them with HDBSCAN, and outputs the cluster assignments for each pulse.

>>    Explanation: We load the model and create a DataLoader for the new data (each sample being one pulse train). For each pulse train, we obtain the
	embedding matrix and apply cluster_embeddings. The resulting cluster labels (0,1,2,... for clusters, and possibly -1 for noise points) are then 
	output. In a real setting, one might want to save these labels to a file or further post-process them. The script above simply prints the number 
	of clusters found and sample output for pulses. The user can replace the print statements with code to integrate the results into their application
	(for example, grouping pulses by cluster to form deinterleaved pulse trains).
