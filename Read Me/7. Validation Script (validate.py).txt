>>    The validation script loads a saved model and evaluates it on a validation or test dataset, reporting the clustering metrics.
	This can be used after training to get a final performance measurement on unseen data


>>	Explanation: This script is similar to the validation portion inside train.py, but standalone. It loads the model from disk, 
	iterates through each pulse train in the validation set, clusters the embeddings, and computes metrics. It prints metrics per
	pulse train and overall average metrics. This is useful for a final evaluation on a test set as well.
